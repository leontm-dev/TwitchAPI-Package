# TwitchAPI-Package

This is an unofficial package for the TwitchAPI. With this package you can easily interact with the TwitchAPI, but you still need a twitch app and a user oauth token. This package is not directly from Twitch or linked to the company itself.

## How to use this package

To use this package, you still need your own Twitch Application and own user tokens! The rest is done for you.
